    <b><big>What is Food Ethics ?</big></b><br>
    <p>Food ethics is a form of enquiry or critical reflection on ethical questions applied to food. Food ethics allow us to define our values (what we think is good) and our principles (what we think is right), in order to redirect our thinking.

                <li><b><big>History and Development of Food Ethics:</big></b></li>
                <p>During the second half of the twentieth century, major transformations occurred in the agrifood system of developed countries. Scientiﬁc and technological progress led to many advances in agriculture. These ranged from the introduction of farm machinery to the use of synthetic pesticides, the development of new seed varieties to the conﬁguration of livestock production systems in intensive livestock units. These innovations resulted in increased yields and agricultural productivity. They were accompanied in the food manufacturing and retailing sectors by the rise of industrial processed food, fast food and “ready-toeat” meals, with almost 70 % of food purchased in supermarkets and a growing number of people eating outside their homes. Concomitantly, the agrifood supply chain underwent signiﬁcant restructuring through the means of economic concentration and vertical integration, international trade and market liberalization, paving the way for the dominant role of transnational food companies and a subsequent shift in market power from manufacturing to retailing. Taken together, these transformations enabled Western societies to meet their consumer demand for tasty, diverse, and convenient food products, at lower prices.</p>
                <p>However, there are downsides to this success story and they draw their sources from the very innovations and tenets (e.g., economic and commercial) on which this rapid expansion was made possible. For instance, the agrifood system is vividly criticized for its detrimental effect on the environment, farm animal welfare, the social fabric of rural communities, and food security in developing countries. It is also accused of having prompted, or at least contributed to, the worldwide obesity crisis. All of these issues now fall on the agenda of agricultural and food policies.</p>

                <li><b><big>Life in the Globalized Village: Ethical Issues raised by Food Insecurity</big></b>

                    <p>Food insecurity is described as a “situation that exists when people lack secure access to sufﬁcient amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal growth and development and an active and healthy life” (FAO et al. 2013, p. 50). Globally, it is estimated that 842 million people were unable to meet their dietary energy requirements in 2011–2013. Unquestionably, hungry people are found everywhere in the world. In afﬂuent societies, food insecurity presents itself as a hidden problem because it is a symptom of the poverty of otherwise socioeconomically vulnerable groups like senior people, adults with disabilities, low-wages workers, and single parents. As compelling as the plight of these individuals might be, the situation in developing countries is unparalleled. It is no insigniﬁcant fact indeed that 98 % of hungry people live in developing countries, wherein 14.3 % of the population face the severe challenge of chronic undernourishment (FAO et al. 2013).</p><br><br>

                    <p>A common point in the aforesaid discourses lies in their global approach, which upholds the basic moral vision of a world community wherein obligations are universal in scope, encompassing everyone everywhere, and where people are incited to develop an identity and set of loyalties that are attuned with this moral outlook (Dower 2003). In this regards, food insecurity ethics is correlated with a worldview accentuating interconnectedness. This feature associates food insecurity as an ethical issue with the idea of “globalization.” The association thus made however does not relate to globalization as a process of integration, but as a moral fact providing an ethical basis to the duty to help others. It follows then that the global approach underlying food insecurity ethics is distinct from food insecurity as a globalized food issue or, as a consequence of the globalization of the agrifood system on the act of eating food. Whereas the ﬁrst stands ﬁrmly within the realm of ethical theory, the second concerns the causes of food insecurity in developing countries. A subtle difference emerges between the ethical response to food insecurity, which must be apprehended as a global or universal imperative, and the contribution of globalization, as a process, to food insecurity. Globalization is introduced into the debates on food insecurity in two distinct ways, which are mostly independent from one another.</p>

        </h3><br>
        <p>Frequently perceived as two sides of the same coin, obesity and food instability represent – in connection with food consumption – archetypal cases of ethical concern performing largely or incompletely from the globalization of the agrifood system. Still, whereas obesity has come an transnational concern with the spread of Western food culture, food instability is still largely dependent on general governance and policy conditions at the public position, with globalization playing an aggravating, yet subsidiary part. On the other hand, clarifying the charge against globalization highlights in both cases its part as a crucial determinant of effectiveness in the choice of applicable actions as well as a contributing factor to the developing importance of food quality and peace as enabling values in a global food ethics.</p>

    <p>Few areas of research and development have captured the imagination with the potential for such broad impact and implications as has nanoscience and nanotechnology. Applications for nanotechnology cross such disparate ﬁelds of research, development, and production as materials science (with agricultural, industrial/manufacturing, and textile applications), energy production, environmental sciences, information and communication technologies, cosmetics, healthcare (with diagnostics, drug delivery, gene therapy, and potential contributions to regenerative medicine), and the possibility of futuristic applications with nanobots and nanotechnology assemblers. As of late 2014, an inventory by the Woodrow Wilson Center identiﬁed over 1,800 consumer products containing nanoscale materials (Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies 2014).</p><br>
    <p>“Nanoscale technology” or “nanotechnology” generally refers to the products of science and engineering that seek to understand and control matter at the nanoscale level. While deﬁnitions of the terminology are not universally agreed upon, the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI n.d.) deﬁnes the “nanoscale” as the “dimensional range of approximately 1–100 nm” (a nanometer is one-billionth of a meter). Comparatively, a sheet of paper is roughly 100,000 nm thick. The ability to manipulate and control materials at the nanoscale level offers a variety of promising and wide-ranging applications. From enhancements to already existent consumer products to advances in industrial manufacturing to regenerative medicine and the possibility of futuristic applications, nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize far-reaching aspects of human life. Strong proponents of the future of these technologies offer visions that seem to stretch the limits of credulity and posit applications that may seem more at home in science ﬁction novels and ﬁlms. Such proposals have led others to charge that this very promise has led to unreasonable research hype and speculations, and thus critics within the research and ethics communities increasingly are calling for more chastened projections of potential research deliverables, as well as what they claim are more “realistic” potential beneﬁts.</p>

        <p>“Nanotechnology” was ﬁrst coined in 1974 by the Japanese researcher Norio Taniguchi “to mean precision machining with tolerances of a micrometer or less” (Voss 1999). While this marked the ﬁrst known usage of the term, the formal discipline of nanoscience is indebted to the work of Richard Feynman, a physicist who speculated in a 1959 presentation “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.” In his talk, Feynman (1960) explored the possibility of printing the entire 24 volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica on the head of a pin, thus requiring the equivalent of an electron microscope to read the nanometer-scale transcription. Feynman speculated on the ability to manipulate material at the atomic and molecular level to create what would later be referred to as nanoscale devices or nanomachines utilizing a “bottom-up approach” (O’Mathúna 2009). This “bottom-up approach” of nanoscale assembly is often contrasted with a “top-down approach” that seeks to apply larger-scale manufacturing techniques and principles at increasingly smaller scales (Navarro and Planell 2012; Mitchell et al. 2007). Feynman’s 1959 presentation advanced possibilities that would characterize both approaches.</p>

        <p>A major breakthrough in contemporary nanotechnology research occurred in 1985 with the creation of a new form of carbon known as the buckminsterfullerene or more commonly a “buckyball” (also bucky-ball) due to its resemblance to a soccer ball. The buckyball was followed in 1991 with the related development of carbon nanotubes. Due to their unique structure, carbon nanotubes were viewed as a major development for materials science, as they are approximately “60 times stronger than steel and capable of conducting electricity 1,000 times better than copper” (Khan 2012).</p><br><br>


        <li><b><big>Nanoparticles – essential component of
            nanotechnology</big></b><br></li>
            <p>Nanotechnology is concerned with development and
                utilization of structures and devices with organizational
                features at the intermediate scale between individual
                2
                molecules and about 100 nm where novel properties
                occur as compared to bulk materials. It implies the
                capability to build up tailored nanostructures and
                devices for given functions by control at the atomic and
                molecular levels. Nanotechnology is recognized as an
                emerging enabling technology for the 21st century, in
                addition to the already established areas of information technology and biotechnology. This is because of
                the scientific convergence of physics, chemistry, biology, materials and engineering at nanoscale, and of the
                importance of the control of matter at nanoscale on
                almost all technologies. Nanoparticle manufacturing
                is an essential component of nanotechnology because
                the specific properties are realized at the nanoparticle, nanocrystal or nanolayer level, and assembling of
                precursor particles and related structures is the most
                generic route to generate nanostructured materials.</p>

                            <p>Nanoparticles have been empirically synthesized for
                                thousands of years, for example, the generation of
                                carbon black. A fourth century Roman masterpiece,
                                known as the Lycurgus Cup, exhibits the unusual
                                property of dichronism, appearing to be green in the
                                reflected light and red in transmitted light, because of
                                nanometer particles suspended in the glass (Lambert,
                                1997). It is noticeable that very few nanoparticle synthesis processes have developed their scientific base
                                decades ago, long before other nanotechnology areas
                                have emerged. One finds in this category the pyrolysis process for carbon black and the flame reaction
                                for pigments, particle polymerization techniques, selfassembling of micelles in colloidal suspensions, and
                                chemistry selfassembling. Several kinds of nanoparticles are routinely produced for commercial use via
                                aerosol and colloid reactors in the US, Japan and
                                Europe. The wide range of powder prices is a function of market size, from $0.5/kg for carbon black and
                                Alumina (each with over 5 Mt/year worldwide market) to about $1,000/kg for superconductors (about
                                2 t/year) and Silicon Carbite whiskers (about 1 t/year).
                                Important areas of relevance for nanoparticles and
                                nanotechnology are advanced materials, electronics,
                                biotechnology, pharmaceutics and sensors. Emerging
                                technologies that have been introduced in the last few
                                years already impact tens of billions of dollars production in the 1998 high tech US industries alone. These
                                include hard disks in computers, photographic systems, dispersions with novel optoelectronic properties,
                                information recording layers, bio-detectors, advanced
                                drug delivery systems, chemical mechanical polishing, a new generation of lasers, chemical catalysts,
                                nanoparticle reinforced materials, ink jet systems, colorants, and nanosystems on a chip, to name some of
                                the most important.
                                Assemblies of nano-particles, droplets, bubbles,
                                fibers and tubes with an interstitial medium are defined
                                here as "ultradispersions". This term will mark the difference as compared to ordinary dispersions because
                                of the specific properties and phenomena developed
                                at nanoscale (dispersed phase dimension or interstitial
                                gap).
                                Why nanoparticles?
                                Nanoparticle, crystal and nanolayer manufacturing
                                processes aim to take advantage of four kinds of effects:
                                a) New physical, chemical or biological properties
                                are caused by size scaling. Smaller particle size
                                determines larger interfacial area, an increased number of molecules on the particle interfaces, quantum electromagnetic interactions, increased surface
                                tension, and size confinement effects (from electronic and optic to confined crystallization and flow
                                structures). The wavelike properties of the electrons inside matter are affected by shape and volume variations on the nanometer scale. Quantum
                                effects become significant for organizational structures under 50 nm, and they manifest even at room
                                temperature if their size is under 10 nm.
                                b) New phenomena are due to size reduction to the
                                point where interaction length scales of physical,
                                chemical and biological phenomena ( for instance,
                                the magnetic, laser, photonic, and heat radiation
                                wavelengths) become comparable to the size of the
                                particle, crystal, or respective microstructure grain.
                                Examples are unusual optoelectronic and magnetic
                                properties of nanostructured materials, changes of
                                color of suspensions with particle size, and placing
                                artificial components inside cells.
                                c) Generation of new atomic, molecular and macromolecular structures of materials by using various
                                routes: chemistry (three-dimensional macromolecular structures, chemical selfassembling), nanofabrication (creating nanostructures on surfaces, manipulation of three-dimensional structures), or biotechnology (evolutionary approach, bio-templating, and
                                three-dimensional molecular folding).
                                d) Significant increase of the degree of complexity and
                                speed of processes in particulate systems. Time
                                scales change because of smaller distances and the
                                3
                                increased spectrum of forces with intrinsically short
                                time scales (electrostatic, magnetic, electrophoresis,
                                radiation pressure, others).</p>


                                <li><b><big>Nanotechnologies and the Global Context</big></b><br></li>
                                <p>Finally, within the global context, questions must be raised with respect to just development and use of nanotechnologies, particularly within existing global inequities. Considerations should be given to how such advances in nanotechnologies will help resolve or exacerbate long-standing inequities. The prospect of nanotechnologies to revolutionize the availability of clean water and to expand the shelf life and availability of food and the decreasing expense of improved manufacturing may yield signiﬁcant gains for developing economies with reciprocal potential to improve the median standard of living in such contexts. Yet, these technologies also appear more likely to beneﬁt economically developed countries with respect to intellectual property development and rights from increased patents and further expand such disparities. Additional beneﬁts from nanotechnologies, however, might be seen through signiﬁcant cost reductions in the creation and availability of devices and delivery mechanisms for medical therapeutics and advances in industrial manufacturing. The rapid adoption of mobile communication technologies drastically improving access to global data and communication networks serves as an example of closing a disparity, which global development of nanotechnologies may well follow. Global justice considerations also have been a key component of nanoethics with a common proposal that research funding should privilege those areas of nanotechnology research and development that will have the most signiﬁcant impact for developing countries. Unfortunately, realization of such funding priorities has been modest at best.</p>
                                <figure>

                                <p>Relevant regulatory regimes are also implicated. Setting appropriate regulatory regimes and policy guidelines within individual countries presents particular challenges given the typically slow regulatory and legislative processes and the rapid pace of technology development. Furthermore, the international context for developing such guidelines or regulatory protocols presents even more vexing challenges. Self-regulation presents substantive challenges with respect to the nature of the public risks that may be involved. While guidelines for adequate models of risk management and responsibility of risk have slowly emerged, they are not universally agreed upon. Important parallels for such models may be found with the research, development, and commercialization of genetically modiﬁed organisms (particularly genetically modiﬁed produce). Effort for global governance of nanotechnologies has met with minimal results, though international committees and organizations such as UNESCO, the International Bioethics Committee, and the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientiﬁc Knowledge and Technology continue to play important roles in monitoring developments in nanotechnology research for potential beneﬁts and harms, as well as playing signiﬁcant roles in facilitating public education and discourse (ten Have 2007).</p><br><br>

        <p>Proper technology assessment of these technologies must explore not only important considerations of risk assessment for safety and efﬁciency with respect to individual applications but should raise broader considerations so as to anticipate and address conceptual vacuums that may exist within a rapidly evolving ﬁeld of research and development. Careful consideration must also be given to immediate concerns for potential risks as well as examinations of the broader impact of such technologies for considerations of human nature and human futures both in their individual and global dimensions.

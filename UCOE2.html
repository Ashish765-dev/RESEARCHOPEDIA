    <b><big>Abstract: </big></b><q> In this paper, it focusses on studying the 
        job prediction using different deep neural 
        network models. To predict the future jobs based 
        on Dataset which contains the previous years job 
        opportunities, locations, packages, eligibility 
        criteria and sectors. It focuses that in future 
        which Technology place a major role to get the 
        quality jobs in several sectors. And also analyse 
        the required knowledge to get a qualified job
        based on eligibility. In future how the graduates 
        get jobs based on their skills with the help of the 
        dataset which collects from the different job sites 
        like first Naukri, LinkedIn, Monster etc. The 
        trends of quality-oriented jobs can be analysed
        and easily predict the future job opportunities by 
        applying machine learning technique

                <p>In recent years, the strong 
                    development of Information Technology (IT) has 
                    led to a variety of job positions as well as the 
                    requirements of each type of IT job. With the 
                    diversity, students or job seekers find the job 
                    suitable for their knowledge and skills accumulated 
                    at the school or in the process of working are 
                    challenging. Also, the recruitment company must 
                    filter the profiles of the candidates manually to 
                    choose the people suitable for the position they are 
                    recruiting, causing a lot of time while the number of 
                    applications could be increased to hundreds or 
                    thousands. Therefore, we would like to study the 
                    task of IT job prediction to help them effectively 
                    address the aforementioned issues. Job prediction is 
                    a classification task using several techniques in 
                    machine learning and natural language processing 
                    trying to predict a job based on job descriptions 
                    including job requirements, knowledge, skills, 
                    interests, etc. In this paper, we focus on studying on 
                    job descriptions collected specifically from the 
                    online finding-job sites. In particular, we are 
                    interested in IT job descriptions. The task is 
                    presented as follows. The study will answer the 
                    questions, first, how data mining technique provides 
                    better classification in predicting the employability 
                    of IT graduates? Second, how the data model can be 
                    extracted to predict the employability of IT 
                    graduates? Lastly, how are attributes be identified to 
                    have a significant correlation to Information 
                    Technology employability?</p>

                    <p>Input: Given an IT job description collected 
                        from the online finding-job sites. </p>

                        <p>Output: A predicted job title for this 
                            description.

                                                SQL server- Microsoft server is a relational 
                                                database management system developed by 
Microsoft. As a database server, it is a software 
product with the primary function of and retrieving 
data as requested by other software applicationswhich may run either on the same computer or on 
another computer across a network.</p>
<p>Dataset- In this paper, we use the dataset 
    for IT job prediction. This dataset consists of 
    maximum 10,000 companies’ detail which contains 
    job titles, current vacancies, layoff percentage, new 
    job opportunities. And also contains the eligibility 
    criteria, packages based on the job roles and the 
    previous year data which are collected from the 
    different job sites. The dataset should be balanced 
    one. The process of collecting the dataset is a 
    difficult task because the dataset should be clear to 
    run the built model.
    </p>

    <p>Experiments- To predict the qualityoriented jobs based on the locations, sectors and 
        eligibility criteria. This includes to predict the future 
        trending technologies and required knowledge for 
        the particular jobs, to predict that how many of them 
        have jobs and how many of them doesn’t get the 
        jobs, in future how the graduates get jobs based on 
        their skills with the help of the dataset which collects 
        from the different job sites like first Naukri, 
        LinkedIn, Monster etc. An Overview is explained in 
        figure below. The process of compiling the data 
        requires an understanding of what input given to the 
        modal. The modal has been tested repeatedly and the 
        errors are identified. The identified errors were 
        cleaned and the model has ready to deploy. The 
        predicting process has been started and the result 
        will be visualized based on the given input. The 
        performance of the accurate result is based on the

                                                    future job opportunities is complex and more 
                                                    amount of data requires from the various job sites 
                                                    and companies. From the experimental results and 
                                                    the model built, it can be proposed that the algorithm 
                                                    is a simple and effective model and we proved that
                                                    this method is the best performance for predicting 
                                                    the future job opportunities. It achieved that the best 
                                                    dataset was used to predict.

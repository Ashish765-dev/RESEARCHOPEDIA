    <b><big>Abstract: </big></b><q> State Government fund Allocation and tracking system using Blockchain. State Governments need to oblige countless 
        obligations of a state. The working of state governments includes a tremendous number of exchanges towards different activities that should
        be completed all through the state. This incorporates new activities, fix and support works, granting contracts, paying of government 
        representatives etc. A significant obstacle that the top government face is the low level corruption that is some of the time difficult to follow 
        which denies the state progress which in turn raises protection worries for Donors and beneficiaries. So, Here we propose a savvy framework 
        to utilize blockchain innovation and full proof fund transfer system. The website consists of a donor and beneficiaries. Donors are the one who 
        donates to the needed beneficiaries. Donors could be anyone be it any person or be it any government scheme that helps needy people. The 
        beneficiaries are the people in need of money for their health care i.e hospital bills and medicines of the occurred disease. The beneficiaries 
        only get their payment done safely and transferred to their account when they appeal for the request of donation needed, do the required form 
        casualties and then upload the necessary documents that prove their correctness and need for the money to get the treatment done in any 
        hospital. The framework considers a full evidence, secure and real asset distribution and asset global positioning framework.

            <p>Blockchain innovation depends on an advanced and dispersed record which works in a straightforward climate without the requirement for 
                a confided in power to approve data. Exchanges are approved by diggers explicit hubs in the Blockchain network committed to confirm, 
                approve and record exchanges. This record contains the historical backdrop of every checked exchange while different duplicates of this one 
                of a kind record are dispersed to all members across the organization. Blockchain innovation is in this manner dependent on an organization 
                of PCs and open calculations and conventions instead of customary unified frameworks that depend on trust between various entertainers. 
                Blockchain is the innovation behind Bitcoin, yet its applications go a long way past digital currencies. The Blockchain influences supposed 
                “Brilliant Agreements,” in which terms are carried out in a code and can execute themselves when explicit conditions are met. An enormous 
                number of frameworks and applications can be developed utilizing Brilliant agreement. The accompanying highlights make the progressive 
                innovation of blockchain stick out according to our website-

                <li><b><big>Decentralized: </big></b><q>Blockchains are decentralized in nature implying that no single individual or gathering holds the authority of the general 
                    organization.Donors and beneficiaries both can use the website with ease and ina decentralized manner where all the updates done are seen by 
                    donors and beneficiary each.

                    <li><b><big>Peer to Peer network: </big></b><q>With the utilization of Blockchain, the collaboration between two gatherings through a shared model is effectively 
                        cultivated without the prerequisite of any outsider

                        <li><b><big>Permanent : </big></b><q>The unchanging nature property of a blockchain alludes to the way that any information once composed on the blockchain 
                            can’t be changed. Carefully designed – With the property of permanence installed in blockchains, it gets simpler to identify altering of any 
                            information. In the website, Any alteration done by donor will be notified to the Admin.

            <dt><li><b><big>Problem Statement :</big></b><q>  The major hurdle that the top government faces is low level corruption that is sometimes impossible to track 
                which deprives the needy people.Tracking it is a very difficult task. Here we propose a smart system to track funds allocated by the state 
                government and public donors to beneficiaries as they travel through the blockchain process at each stage.</q></li></dt>

                                                    on hashing. This will help the government in reducing fraud and keeping a clear record of the funds.Blockchain innovation to be utilized in 
                                                    government frameworks as these frameworks are moderate, thick, and prone to corruption.The proposed framework expects to tackle all
